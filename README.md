# 📚 **DocuMind Agent – LLM-powered Knowledge Assistant**  

**DocuMind Agent** is a prototype chatbot that answers questions from uploaded **PDF documents** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
The system combines **LangChain, FAISS, and Hugging Face embeddings** to retrieve relevant context and ground GPT responses in source documents, reducing hallucinations.
