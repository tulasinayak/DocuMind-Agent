#DocuMind Agent – LLM-powered Knowledge Assistant
DocuMind Agent is a prototype chatbot that answers questions from uploaded PDF documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
The system combines LangChain, FAISS, and Hugging Face embeddings to retrieve relevant context and ground GPT responses in source documents, reducing hallucinations.
##Features
1.Document-based Q&A – upload a PDF and ask questions directly.
2.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – ensures responses are grounded in your documents.
3.Vector search with FAISS – fast and scalable semantic retrieval.
4.Embeddings with Hugging Face – sentence-transformers for contextual similarity.
5.Interactive UI with Gradio – simple chat interface for user interaction.
6.Agentic extensions – retrieval, summarization.
